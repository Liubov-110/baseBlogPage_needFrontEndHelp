# baseBlogPage_needFrontEndHelp

I need help of FronEnd engineers to make my blog&amp;portfolio look better.


The main thing I want to change is menu items align to the right when burger menu expands.
Also, footer needs some align refactoring.
And of course I need to ged rid of all those excessive <link ... tags. Not all of them are used.
                                                             
I would be thankful if you help me with that base.html file.
